"Just as Jedis need to prove their mastery of their powers by building a light sabre, developers should prove their mastery by building a blog 'engine'" - Someone online

I can't remember the original source of the paraphrased quote above, but I think it was Scott Hanselman.

The intention here is to try and implement a blog using good SOLID coding practices and keeping a mind to web security etc.

Note * : it's SABRE - suck it Webster.
